# LOD-since-Late-Pliocene
Code related to the study of deriving LOD since Late Pliocene


# Requirements to run the codes:

1. install the following python packages: torch, numpy, scipy, ismember, tqdm
2. make sure you have the data in the folder "data"


# Running the code:

1. run the code "Diffusion_LOD_Late_Pliocene_full.py". You might get the results faster if you have GPUs 
2. the results will be in the folder "output"
